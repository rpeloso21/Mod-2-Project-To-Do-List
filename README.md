This is a to-do list application.

There are 5 inital menu options which are: Add task, view, task, mark task complete, delete task, and quit.
Tasks can be added and then viewed in several different ways through a sub-menu under the view task option.
Tasks can then be marked complete and will show up differently based on the view options that the user selects.
There is also an option to view todays tasks when the user enters today's date.

Once the user quits the app, a "thank you" message will appear, and the application will close.
